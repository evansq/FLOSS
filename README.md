# FLOSS
!FLOSS CREATED 2015
!RENSSELAER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE
!BY QUADIS EVANS
!FOR BYSTROFF LAB GROUP 
!TO BE INTEGRATED INTO INTERACTIVE ROSETTA
!PURPOSE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROGRAM IS TO PRESENT THE RESULTS OF A LOOP SEARCH WHICH HAS BEEN DEFINED BY THE LINEAR DISTANCES BETWEEN THE ANCHORING RESIDUES CALPHA AND CBETA. THE TOP 100 RESULTS ARE GIVEN IN STANDARD OUTPUT. THE USER DEFINED DISTANCE RANGES FROM 0-20 ANGSTROMS FOR BOTH CALPHA AND CBETA. THE COMMAND IS GIVEN AS [CALPHA(F8.3)][CBETA(F8.3)][CALPHA DEVIATION(F8.3)][CBETA DEVIATION(F8.3)] AS STANDARD INPUT.

!TO TEST, COMPILE BOTH FILES ACCORDINGLY:
!=gfortran -g FLOSS.f90 -o [executable name](FLOSS)
!=gfortran -g SEARCH.f90 -o [executable name](SEARCH)
!=f2py SEARCH.f90 -m --overwrite-signature SEARCH -h SEARCH.pyf
!=f2py -c --fcompiler=gfortran SEARCH.pyf SEARCH.f90

!RUN SEARCH IN PYTHON SHELL USING THE FOLLOWING COMMAND:
!=import [executable name]
!=print [executable name].search.foo(arg1:7)

!RUNNING THE SEARCH PROGRAM REQUIRES SEVEN(7) VARIABLES TO BE SPECIFIED AT THE COMMAND LINE: 1) CA SEPARATION(ANGSTROMS/10), 2) CB SEPARATION(ANGSTROMS/10), 3) CA DEVIATION(ANGSTROMS/10), 4) CB DEVIATION(ANGSTROMS/10), 5) MAXIMUM NUMBER OF RESULTS, 6) PEPTIDE LENGTH(RESIDUES) 7) PEPTIDE LENGTH DEVIATION. 

!TO USE, COMPILE (GFORTRAN) AND RUN FLOSS.F90 BEFORE SEARCH.F90. FLOSS.F90 GENERATES TWO DIRECT ACCES FILES FILE WHICH STORE ALL INFORMATION AS WELL AS THE LOOKUP TABLE FOR FAST INDEXING. THE INFORMATION IS RECOVERED FROM PDBSELECT DATABASE AND ORGANIZED IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER:
"( 2(I4), 2(A4, I4), 4F8.3, A4, A1, I4)"[CABIN][CBBIN][ANCHOR1AMINOACID3LETTERCODE][RESIDUENUMBER][ANCHOR2AMINOACID3LETTERCODE][CASEP][CBSEP][CACROSS][CBCROSS][PDBID][CHAINID][LENGTH]"

!A FILE IS ALSO INCLUDED WHICH LISTS THE PDB ID AND CHAIN ID WITHIN PDBSELECT(SPACE DELIMITED) TO RUN. THE LOOKUPTABLE FOR INDEXING IS STORE AS LOOKUPTABLE.TXT UPON FINISHING.

!ALL FILES MUST BE STORED WITHIN THE SAME FOLDER. ALL PDB FILES SPECIFIED BY ID MUST ALSO BE PRESENT IN THIS FILE.

DOWNLOAD THE PDB FILES SPECIFIED BY THE PDBID IN THE PDB2 FILE.
