!FOR BYSTROFF LAB GROUP 
!TO BE INTEGRATED INTO INTERACTIVE ROSETTA
!PURPOSE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROGRAM IS TO PRESENT THE RESULTS OF A LOOP SEARCH WHICH HAS BEEN DEFINED BY THE LINEAR DISTANCES BETWEEN THE ANCHORING RESIDUES CALPHA AND CBETA. THE TOP 100 RESULTS ARE GIVEN IN STANDARD OUTPUT. THE USER DEFINED DISTANCE RANGES FROM 0-20 ANGSTROMS FOR BOTH CALPHA AND CBETA. THE COMMAND IS GIVEN AS [CALPHA(F8.3)][CBETA(F8.3)][CALPHA DEVIATION(F8.3)][CBETA DEVIATION(F8.3)] AS STANDARD INPUT.

!TO TEST, COMPILE (GFORTRAN) AND RUN SEARCH.F90. 

!TO USE, COMPILE (GFORTRAN) AND RUN FLOSS.F90 BEFORE SEARCH.F90. FLOSS.F90 GENERATES THE DIRECT ACCESS FILE WHICH STORES THE LOOKUPTABLE FOR FAST INDEXING. IT REQUIRES A FILE (TEXT) WHICH LISTS THE PDB ID AND CHAIN ID (SPACE DELIMITED) TO RUN. THE LOOKUPTABLE FOR INDEXING IS STORE AS LOOKUPTABLE.TXT UPON FINISHING.

!ALL FILES MUST BE STORED WITHIN THE SAME FOLDER. ALL PDB FILES SPECIFIED BY ID MUST ALSO BE PRESENT IN THIS FILE.

DOWNLOAD THE PDB FILES SPECIFIED BY THE PDBID IN THE PDB2 FILE.
